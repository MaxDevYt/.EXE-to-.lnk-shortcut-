# .EXE-to-.lnk-shortcut-
Converts executables to shortcuts which can run your file.

This tool is intended for only educational purposes only.

# About

This script is written in Python 3.8.

There are certain prerequisite modules that need to be installed if you don't have them already in order for the script to run properly.

pip install winshell
pip install pypiwin32

# Functionality

What this script basically does is create a shortcut and the edits the Target location and adds arguments which allows it to run PowerShell and execute commands.

This doesn't make your File Undetectable or FUD in anyway! 

This is my first program uploaded on Github, hope this broadens your coding knowledge in any way.
